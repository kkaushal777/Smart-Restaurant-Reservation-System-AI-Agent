## Use Case (in 100 words)

FoodieSpot wants to streamline its reservation management across multiple locations. The AI Reservation Agent will allow customers to book tables by simply chatting naturally. Customers can specify their preferences — location, cuisine, time, party size — and the agent will recommend the best-fit restaurant or book directly. It will handle modifications and cancellations too. The agent ensures real-time availability checking, upsells premium experiences (e.g., private seating), and reduces staff load. Designed with scalability in mind, it will eventually be adapted to other hospitality and service industries.

## Key Steps (Bot Flow)

1. Greet user and understand request (Booking / Recommendation / Modification / Cancellation).
2. Extract preferences: number of guests, time, cuisine, location preference.
3. Match with available restaurant slots.
4. Confirm booking with user.
5. Send booking details.
6. Handle modifications or cancellations if user requests.
7. Offer upsells (special arrangements if applicable).
