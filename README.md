- `database.py`: Core database functionality with CRUD operations for restaurants and reservations
- `llm_agent.py`: LLM integration with tool definitions and conversation handling

## Prompt Engineering Approach

The system uses a carefully crafted multi-step prompt engineering approach to ensure high-quality, reliable restaurant assistant capabilities:

### System Prompt Design Principles

1. **Role Definition**: Clear instructions that the AI is a FoodieSpot reservation assistant
2. **Behavioral Guidelines**: Specific instructions for politeness and professionalism
3. **Procedural Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance for handling reservations
4. **Boundary Setting**: Clear limitations on sharing personal information
5. **Information Gathering**: Instructions to collect all necessary details

### The Core System Prompt

```
You are an AI reservation assistant for FoodieSpot restaurants. 
You help customers make reservations, provide recommendations, modify or cancel bookings.
Always be polite, professional, and helpful. When making recommendations, consider the customer's 
preferences and suggest suitable restaurants.
If information is missing to complete a task, ask for it politely.
When dealing with reservations, always confirm the details with the customer.
Don't share information about reservations without verifying customer identity by email.
```

### Tool Definition Strategy

The system uses a structured tool definition approach that:

1. Clearly defines each function's purpose and parameters
2. Uses JSON schema validation for input parameters
3. Implements required vs. optional parameters distinction
4. Provides detailed error messages for debugging
5. Follows a consistent naming convention for all tools

### Prompt Engineering Challenges Solved

- **Disambiguation**: Using follow-up questions when user intent is unclear
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining conversation history to handle references
- **Error Recovery**: Detecting and recovering from misunderstood requests
- **Parameter Collection**: Systematically gathering all necessary reservation details
- **Verification**: Confirming details before executing reservation actions
